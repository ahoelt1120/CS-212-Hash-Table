# CS-212-Hash-Table
Project 3C code for CS 212 at the University of Oregon. This assignment required us to create a C program that implements a hash table.

The project includes three files: project3C.c includes the main function and takes user input for the file and the search word, project3A_hashtable.c implements the hashtable and search functionality, and project3C_hashtable.h is the header file for the hash table functionality.
